NTULearn Downloader!

How it works
- user to provide URL of page with pdf download links 
	# General URL structure: scheme://netloc/path;parameters?query#fragment
- use requests to get html code
- use BeautifulSoup to parse html and get the links with pdf 
- show the list of items it has found, will start download on user prompt (Y/N)
- user to input download path 

Version 1.0
- scrapes pdf files from a provided link. very effectively.


Features to implement:
!!- login function @ ntulearn
- security features: limiting input types
- GUI @ tkinter, tkfiledialog @ askdirectory(**options)

- download lecture videos
- user can choose which docs to download 
- recursive search through all directories given the content page
- recursive search through all directories given the course code 

- anyway to do it without having the users to install the packages?
