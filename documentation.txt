NTULearn Downloader!

Motivation:
Ever felt frustrated when you have to download your lecture notes so labouriously, clicking the links and pressing ctrl+s for every document one-by-one?
We at ___ felt so too and here's a tool to help us! :)
	//something that makes life simpler
All you have to do is to input the URL and download path :D

How it works
- user to provide URL of page with pdf download links 
	# General URL structure: scheme://netloc/path;parameters?query#fragment
- use requests to get html code
- use BeautifulSoup to parse html and get the links with pdf 
- show the list of items it has found, will start download on user prompt (Y/N)
- user to input download path 

Version 1.0
- scrapes pdf files from provided link 


Features to implement:
!!- login function
- security features: limiting input types

- download lecture videos
- user can choose which docs to download 
- recursive search through all directories given the content page
- recursive search through all directories given the course code 

- no need to use python to do? 
- GUI @ tkinter, tkfiledialog @ askdirectory(**options)
